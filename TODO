- Failover strategies
  - Client:
     * If connected for the first time, try to connect to at least one server from the server array
     * If already connected to a server, and it goes down, the client should go down as well
  - Worker:
     * If connected for the first time, try to connect to as many servers as it can. 
       Loop trough the bad servers, trying to reconnect to them as well.
     * If a already connected to a server, and it goes down, wait and try to reconnect again.
